# Roblosats

Roblosats is [RoboSats](https://github.com/RoboSats/robosats) for Bitcoin on the **BLAKE2b
chain**: the same peer-to-peer exchange (robots, Lightning hold invoices as escrow and bonds,
PGP chat, Tor), running on that chain's own Lightning network.

## What is different from RoboSats

All changes live on the `roblosats` branch as a small set of commits on top of an upstream
release tag, so each new RoboSats release can be taken by rebasing that branch.

- **Prices** (`api/utils.py`, `nonkyc_rates`): BTCB2 in USD from two venues, NonKYC (its
  BTCB2/USDT and BTCB2/BTC x BTC/USD books count as one venue) and Neoxa. Every quote is the
  order-book midpoint with a spread of at most 5 % (`BTCB2_MAX_SPREAD`), never the last trade.
  The price is the mean of the two venues, and it never moves more than `BTCB2_MAX_STEP`
  (5 %) per refresh. With fewer than `BTCB2_MIN_VENUES` (2) answering, or if they differ by
  more than `BTCB2_MAX_VENUE_DEVIATION` (10 %), the last stored price is kept for
  `BTCB2_SINGLE_VENUE_GRACE` seconds (3600), counted from the last refresh that had both
  venues agreeing; after that the remaining venue (or, if they still disagree, the one closer
  to the stored price) is followed again, still at most 5 % per refresh. The time of that
  last good refresh is kept in Redis (`roblosats:btcb2_quorum_at`); if Redis loses it, the
  hour starts again. With no venue at all the stored price is kept (`BTCB2_FALLBACK_USD` only
  on a first start with nothing stored). Every other fiat currency is that price times
  yadio's USD rate. Set

  ```
  MARKET_PRICE_APIS = 'https://mempool.kilombino.com/nonkyc-ticker'
  NEOXA_TICKER_URL  = 'https://mempool.kilombino.com/neoxa-ticker'
  ```

  Those two are proxies on the Roblosats maintainer's mempool server, because NonKYC and
  Neoxa block Tor exits: using them means trusting that server with your price. A
  coordinator with clearnet access can point straight at the venues instead:

  ```
  MARKET_PRICE_APIS = 'https://api.nonkyc.io/api/v2/ticker/BTCB2_USDT'
  NEOXA_TICKER_URL  = 'https://neoxa.exchange/api/exchange/ticker/BTCB2_USDC'
  ```

  `MARKET_PRICE_APIS` pointing at Neoxa alone (the setting before 22 oct 2026) still works,
  but it is a single venue: switch to the two above.
- **PostgreSQL only**: order actions are serialized with PostgreSQL advisory locks and the
  reward ledger uses PostgreSQL triggers; the coordinator refuses to run order actions on
  any other database.
- **Fee rates** for on-chain payouts come from the chain's own mempool (`MEMPOOL_FEES_URL`,
  default https://mempool.kilombino.com), not mempool.space.
- **Devfund**: the `DEVFUND` fraction of each successful order's proceeds goes by keysend to the
  Roblosats maintainer's node (`devfund_pubkey.json` in this branch), which keeps Roblosats and its
  security fixes going. It is optional: `DEVFUND=0` sends nothing.
- **Trade limits** (`MIN_TRADE`, `MAX_TRADE`) come from the environment: a sat of this chain is
  worth about 1/100 of one on the SHA-256 chain, so the same fiat amounts need more sats.
- **Federation**: its own, starting with Kilobot only; no third-party platforms or lnproxies
  (they are on the other chain).
- **Brand**: name, robot logo and icons, links (GitHub, Telegram community, BLAKE2b LN explorer).
- **Android**: application id `com.roblosats`, so it installs next to RoboSats.
- **Fix**: the web client froze with fewer than three coordinators (it waited forever for a
  third distinct relay).
- `Dockerfile.roblosats` builds the coordinator image with the web client inside.

## Updating to a new RoboSats release

```sh
git fetch upstream --tags
git rebase --onto vX.Y.Z-alpha v0.8.7-alpha roblosats   # previous base → new tag
# rebuild: docker build -f Dockerfile.roblosats -t roblosats:X.Y.Z-rl1 .
```
